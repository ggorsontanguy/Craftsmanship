## Cyber-dojo
[from cyber-dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org/) :
You'll have almost all public green field katas here.
Green field means without starting code.
Usually, refactoring katas starts from existing code and are described as brown field.

## Books
They often have copyrighted content, but some points to free or public exercises.
Anyway books pointed here are surely good to read !

## Concurrency
Concurrency is hard to develop and hard to test.
Hopefully we rarely need it.
The concurrency problem appears only when you have a shared mutable state, so :

1. Do not share a mutable state
2. Make a shared state immutable
3. Share objects that have no states

If you can't make it, you'll have a problem to guaranty consistent shared mutable states...
