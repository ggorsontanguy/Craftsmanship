        <p>A Tamagotchi is a small, handheld digital pet that you can feed, play with, put to bed and clean up after. Look after it well by feeding it the right kinds of foods, showering it with attention and cleaning up after it when required, and your Tamagotchi will grow up to be a smart, well-respected member of society.</p>
        <p>To aid the quick release of this project, we require you to deliver the absolute minimum that could reasonably be called a Tamagotchi pet as soon as possible. Then we're going to add all of the good stuff- different foods and games to play, all purchasable with our own very special currency, the Kablammo.</p>

    <h2>Feature 1 - Basic Needs</h2>

    <p>
        Like we said before, first things first is to get all of the basic needs finished so we have some semblance of a basic Tamagotchi pet. We're talking about things like hungriness, fullness, tiredness, happiness and of course, the actions required to mitigate these needs. We're not really sure of the implementation though. We were thinking of needs on a scale of 1-100, with different activities having different effects on them, but we'll go with whatever you think is best.</p>
