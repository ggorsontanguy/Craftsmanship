## Print diamond
[A present from Seb Rose](http://claysnow.co.uk/recycling-tests-in-tdd/)

Given a letter print a diamond starting with 'A'
with the supplied letter at the widest point.

For example: print-diamond 'C' prints

__A__<br/>
_B_B_<br/>
C___C<br/>
_B_B_<br/>
__A__<br/>

You may use spaces instead of underscores in your implementations.
