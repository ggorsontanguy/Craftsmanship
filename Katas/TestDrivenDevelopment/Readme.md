Now let's see each kata independently :

### String Calculator
@see Emily bache coding Dojo Handbook, that give this kata's author.
It has a first base feature that will evolve several times.
You will experience how you can safely add feature and tune your code to new needs without fear to break existing functionality.

### Roman Numerals (and Reversed)
They have both a full conversion feature.
Those conversions are not trivial, similar in functionality (from arabic to roman and its reverse) but may have very different implementations evens from the same pairs.
You may need more than one object to implement them nicely.

### Bowling Game
You have to calculate the score of a bowling game.
Score in a frame depends on future bonus balls and that may be sensible.
Be sure to test correctly your features before moving on to the next one.
You may do it twice as there is two methods in the api.
You may use each as the main algorithm and try to state after why it matters.


### Print diamond
A simple need, hard to do well.
You should work on emerging design here.
By adding test, duplication of code is visible, try to make them really identical to factorise it.

### Berlin Clock
You will have to convert hours and minutes in four lines of text representing state of lamps.
Each lines represent a part of the global state, and you will have to figure out how to test these kinds of complex state.
